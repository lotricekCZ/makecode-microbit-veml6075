# Microbit Makecode VEML6075 UVA/B light sensor extension
This extension lets user work with Blocks language used mainly for educational purposes
## Usage
First, use `begin_void()` or representing block to initiate sensor, Though it seems to be completely unnecesary.
Then a wide range from `set_coefficients()` to `readUVI()` can be used. For simplicity, it may be fully replaced with `get()` and `set()` functions in the future.
